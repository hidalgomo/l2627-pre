        <h3>Fund the Front Lines</h3>
        <p>
            This isn't about partisanship. It's about clean water, road repairs, safe schools, first responders and
            well-staffed hospitals. And the bottom line is this: we can't defeat the coronavirus and reopen the economy
            without strong, well-funded public services. We're shouting this message from the rooftops â€” and now over
            the airwaves.
        </p>
        <p>Contact Congress and tell them to fund the front lines by texting FUND to 237-263.</p>
