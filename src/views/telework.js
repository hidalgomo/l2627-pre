                    This isn't about partisanship. It's about clean water, road repairs, safe schools, first responders and
                    well-staffed hospitals. And the bottom line is this: we can't defeat the coronavirus and reopen the economy
                    without strong, well-funded public services. We're shouting this message from the rooftops â€” and now over
                    the airwaves.
