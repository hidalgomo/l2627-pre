                        There there is complete breakdown of air conditioning, the City will have one day from the date 
                        of notification by the Union to repair the air conditioning system. If the air conditioning 
                        has not been repaired after the first day, affected employees shall receive, in the discretion 
                        of the agency, beginning with the second day of the complete breakdown, either compensatory

                    approximately 1 1/2 hours prior to the end of the workday. A partial breakdown of air conditioning 
                    for the purposes of this Interpretive Memorandum shall occur when the employer representative 
                    certifies that despite the use of the air conditioning equipment the temperature indoors 
                    exceeds 85Â°. The employer representative may be accompanied by one employee representative
