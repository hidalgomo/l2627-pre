                    services under circumstances not authorized by law, as a means of redressing or otherwise 
                    protesting alleged violations of this Section, shall be docked pay for any unauthorized

                    whether the subject facilities meet the standards of subsection (a) of this Section. If 
                    the arbitrator determines that the University is in violation of this Section, the 
                    University shall take appropriate steps to remedy the violation. If in the opinion of 
                    the Union the University does not achieve compliance within a reasonable period of time, 
                    the Union may reassert its claim to the arbitrator. Upon such second submission, if 
                    the arbitrator finds that the University has had a reasonable time to comply with the 
                    terms of this Section and has failed to do so, then and only then, the arbitrator may order 
                    the University to follow a particular course of action which will effectuate compliance 
                    with the terms of this section. However, such remedy shall not exceed appropriations 
                    available in the current budget allocation for the University for such purposes.
