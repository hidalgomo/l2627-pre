                    Courses on the Internet are eligible for tuition reimbursement the same as courses 
                    in the classroom (see Tuition Reimbursement on the left). In addition, Local 2627 
                    has an arrangement with Enterprise Training. When one of our members passes an 
                    Enterprise Training on-line course and files for tuition reimbursement the benefit 
                    does not stop there. As far as Enterprise Training is concerned, when the member 
                    pays for the initial course he or she was actually paying for a year's worth of 
                    on-line courses. The member can take as many on-line courses from Enterprise 
                    Training as he or she likes for the rest of the year at no additional cost.
