            <p>
                When, how and why to file a grievance
                <br />
                Your union contract provides a
                mechanism for you to make sure your employer abides by
                the contract. That mechanism is the grievance procedure.
                When an employer violates a provision of the contract,
                union members have a right to file a grievance.

            <h4>When to File a Grievance</h4>
            <p>
                File a grievance whenever
                your employer violates a provision of the contract. If
                you are not sure about what the contract says on the
                matter, talk it over with your shop steward. Some
                examples of typical grievance issues are out-of-title
                work, overtime pay, and disciplinary procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not every gripe is a
                grievance there are problems you may face that are not
                covered in the contract (for instance, your boss may be
                rude). Grievances are specifically about contract
                violations, but sometimes are more broadly defined. But
                even if your complaint doesn't meet the definition of a
                grievance, it doesn't mean you can't take action you,
                your steward, other workers in your shop and the union
                together can organize and pressure the employer.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, if the
                problem you are having is covered in the contract, then
                you should definitely file a grievance.

            <h4>How a Grievance works</h4>
            <p>
                Shop stewards have copies of
                grievance forms. The first step in pursuing a grievance
                is to talk to your steward and fill out the form. The
                grievance should contain a clear statement of the issue
                and a reference to the relevant rule or contract
                section.
            </p>
            <p>
                Local 2627 members work in
                mayoral and non-mayoral agencies. The grievance procedure
                for each contract is a little different. However, they
                all follow a general pattern that includes three or four
                steps.
            </p>
            <p>
                THE INITIAL STEP is to take the
                written account of the grievance (the grievance form) to
                the immediate supervisor or department head. A grievance
                must be initiated within a certain number of days from
                when the event occurred that is being grieved; check your
                contract to make sure you know the deadlines that apply
                in your case. This step involves the member, the steward
                and immediate management. Management has a certain number
                of days to respond to the grievance. If they do not
                respond in that time frame, or if the member or the union
                is not satisfied with the response at this level, the
                grievance proceeds to the next step.
            </p>
            <p>
                THE NEXT STEP or steps involves
                taking the case to higher levels of management. At this
                step, the staff rep usually gets involved. A hearing may
                be held, and witnesses may be called. Again, there is a
                specific number of days in which management must respond.
                If the member or the union is not satisfied, they may
                appeal the decision to the next step. Here, too, you must
                act within a certain number of days.
            </p>
            <p>
                THE FINAL STEP in a grievance
                procedure is binding arbitration. Binding arbitration
                means that an impartial, outside party hears the case and
                makes a decision, which the employer, the worker and the
                union must obey. As part of the contract, the union and
                the employer have agreed in advance on individuals who
                will serve as arbiters.

            <h4>Why Filing a Grievance is Important</h4>
            <p>
                Sometimes union members know
                the employer is violating the contract but they are
                hesitant to file a grievance because they think it's no
                big deal or they don't want to get in trouble. But
                contract violations are a big deal! And it's your right
                to grieve them; your boss cannot retaliate against you
                for filing a grievance. Whenever we let an employer
                violate the contract without challenging him, we are
                weakening the contract for all Local 2627 members it
                sends a message that we will not enforce the contract.
                When we file grievances, we let employers know that we
                take the contract seriously and we will make them take it
                seriously, too. Sometimes, just knowing union members
                will enforce their rights acts as a deterrent, and
                management will think twice before violating the
                contract.
