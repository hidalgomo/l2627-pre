                                DC 37 members can receive discounts on computer purchases through a discount
                                plan arranged by Lenovo and the union. The union expects the plan to be part
                                of the merchant discount program on big-ticket products that the city agreed
                                to under the 2000-2002 economic agreement.
                            </p>

                                    "Though we negotiated on our own to get the Lenovo discount plan, we expect that
                                    it will be incorporated into the city's merchant discount program, once it gets
                                    off the ground,"
                                </em>

                            <p>
                                The Lenovo plan offers up to 10 percent off the prices on purchases normally made
                                through the company's website, catalogue or 800 telephone number. The discounts for
                                DC 37 members are available through Lenovo's Corporate Employee Purchase Program.
                                Members must use a special code, "4417," to participate in the discount plan.

                                <em>"It is also wise to shop around, because retailers also offer discounts,"</em>
