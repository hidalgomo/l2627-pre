                <h3 className="text-3xl">Lenovo offers discounts on new computers to DC 37 members</h3>
                <p className="py-4">
                    DC 37 members can receive discounts on computer purchases through a discount
                    plan arranged by Lenovo and the union. The union expects the plan to be part
                    of the merchant discount program on big-ticket products that the city agreed
                    to under the 2000-2002 economic agreement.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    <em>
                        "Though we negotiated on our own to get the Lenovo discount plan, we expect that
                        it will be incorporated into the city's merchant discount program, once it gets
                        off the ground,"
                    </em>
                    said Dennis Sullivan, director of research and negotiations.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    The Lenovo plan offers up to 10 percent off the prices on purchases normally made
                    through the company's website, catalogue or 800 telephone number. The discounts for
                    DC 37 members are available through Lenovo's Corporate Employee Purchase Program.
                    Members must use a special code, "4417," to participate in the discount plan.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    To find out about the products offered by the Lenovo Corporate Employee Purchase
                    Program, go to their <Link tp="http://www.lenovo.com/shop/deals/4417/" target="_blank" title="Lenovo Direct website just for DC 37">website here</Link>.
                    The available products include computers, notebooks, CD-and DVD-ROM drives and software.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    <em>
                        "At any time, the products vary, so it pays to check the website to consider the latest offers,"
                    </em>
                    said Moira Dolan, an assistant director in the DC 37 Research and Negotiations Dept.,
                    who arranged for the union's participation in the program.
                    <em>
                        "It is also wise to shop around, because retailers also offer discounts,"
                    </em>
                    Ms. Dolan said.
